# Water-Hyacinth-classification
Water Hyacinth is a highly invasive floating plant that poses significant ecological, economic, and health challenges. It rapidly spreads, forming dense mats that block waterways, degrade water quality, and disrupt ecosystems. This project aims to automate the classification and monitoring of water hyacinth growth using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

## Dataset Acquisition: 
Invasive Plants Dataset: Acquired from Mendeley.com, consisting of images from Bangladesh.
Non-Invasive Plants Dataset: Created by scraping 800 images from the internet.
Diversity: Images taken by different mobile phones with varying camera resolutions to enhance model robustness.

## Model Development:
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Utilized to classify aquatic plants as invasive or non-invasive. Invasive plants are classified into Water Lettuce, Heartleaf False Pickerelweed, Common Water Hyacinth, and Common Duckweeds.


## Website Development:
- Identification Tool: A user-friendly tool for identifying water hyacinth from other weeds through image uploads.
- Reporting Tab: A dedicated section for users to report water hyacinth sightings, including name, location, severity, and image upload.
- User Engagement: Prompts and feedback mechanisms to encourage reporting and social sharing.
- Communication with Removal Services: Facilitates connections between users and removal services, providing contact information and notifications.
- Accessibility: Ensures the website is accessible to all users and optimized for various devices
