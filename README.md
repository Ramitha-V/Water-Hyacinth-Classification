# Water-Hyacinth-classification
Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) is a highly invasive aquatic plant species that poses significant environmental and economic threats to water bodies worldwide. Its rapid proliferation can lead to habitat degradation, biodiversity loss, and disruption of ecosystem services as was recently seen in Pune. In this study, we propose an automated classification and monitoring system for water hyacinth growth to aid in environmental management efforts. By enabling civilians to contribute to the capturing and complaining of growth/over-growth of water hyacinth in a region, we aim to develop algorithms for the detection and classification of water hyacinth patches. Machine learning algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), will be employed for image analysis and classification tasks. Additionally, we aim to integrate geographical information systems (GIS) to facilitate spatial analysis and mapping of water hyacinth distribution patterns over time. The proposed system will provide real-time monitoring capabilities, allowing for timely intervention and management strategies to mitigate the spread of water hyacinth infestations. Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to more effective and sustainable management of water resources and ecosystems impacted by water hyacinth proliferation.
